1) the process started by EDA , I loaded the file using pandas library, then printed its info and checked for missing values by calculating their sum, then for the summary statistics i printed the main key statistics (count,mean .std,median,.....) and visualized all the numerical columns in a bar graph
2)for the data preprocessing , i handled missing values by filling some of them using estimated values from either the median or mode (currency ,status, and sales amount), however if a column had too many missing values for it to be useful , i dropped it , an for the Date column i changed it to a datetime format so that it is usable.,at the end i printed the summary statistics again to show changes
for outlier detection i used boxplot technique by calculating the IQR and finding lower limit and upper limit and foung the outliers and treated them by capping the values within the bounds

3) visualization : i visualized both numerical and categorical columns using different ways (heatmap, line plot, bar graph, time series)
4) i used three model trainings : in all of them i divided the data into feature that are used to predict the status, converted needed categorical labels to numerical, and used training group and testing group that was randomized every time.
 *logistic regression (used for binary classification), decision tree (used for both classification and regression), random forest (creates a "forest" of decision trees)
 using fit method
The performance of the model is evaluated using several metrics:
Classification Report: Provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.
Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances in the test set.
Cross-validation. 
4) created a dash app example presenting  the random forest predictive model evaluation and key features (order status count and distribution amount).
